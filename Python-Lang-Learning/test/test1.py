# Instructions
# Create a variable named usd_amount and assign it the value of 100.
# Create a variable named exchange_rate and assign it the value of 0.85 (this means 1 USD is equal to 0.85 EUR).
# Perform the conversion by creating a new variable eur_amount. Multiply usd_amount by exchange_rate.
# Change the data type of eur_amount to an integer.
# Print eur_amount.

usd_amount = 100;
exhange_rate = 0.85 
eur_amt = usd_amount * exhange_rate  
eur_amt = int(eur_amt)
# print(eur_amt)


# Your code starts here

# Step 1: Initialize principal amount

# Step 2: Initialize annual interest rate

# Step 3: Initialize time in years

# Step 4: Calculate Simple Interest

# Step 5: Print the calculated interest
# Make sure to include principal, rate, time, and interest in your print statement


principal = 10000 
interestAmt = 20 
time = 10

SI = principal * interestAmt * time /100

print("This is interest for your " + str(principal) + ", " +str(interestAmt)  + ", " + str(interestAmt) + " is " + str(SI));
